Refer to [this guide][commits] on how to write good commit messages.

## Sign-off

By making a contribution (pull requesting or committing) to the coroICA-matlab project you certify that

* you have the right to submit it to coroICA-matlab.

* you created the contribution/modification; or you based it on previous work that, to the best of your knowledge, is covered by a compatible open source license; or someone who did one of the former provided you with this contribution/modification and you are submitting it without changes.

* you understand and agree that your contribution/modification to this project is public and that a record of it (including all information you submit with it, including copyright notices and your sign-off) is maintained indefinitely and may be redistributed consistent with coroICA-matlab's AGPL v3 license or the open source license(s) involved.

To make your certification explicit we borrow the "sign-off" procedure from the Linux kernel project, i.e., each commit message should contain a line saying

    Signed-off-by: Name Sirname <name.sirname@example.org>

using your real name and email address.
Running the git-commit command with the -s option automatically adds this line.
